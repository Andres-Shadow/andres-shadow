# Hi! I'm Andrés 👋 | Software Developer and Systems & Computer Engineering Student

---

Hello! My name is Andrés, but I often go by shadow/shader on various platforms. I’m from Colombia 🇨🇴 and currently working towards my degree in Systems and Computer Engineering <3. I specialize in backend development, particularly with Java, Golang, and Node.js (JavaScript & TypeScript), I am also growing my frontend skills and studying hard to become a fullstack developer. I’m passionate about learning new technologies and creating impactful software solutions, and I’m exploring No-Code and Low-Code platforms to broaden my understanding of accessible tech development.

## 👨‍💼 About Me

As a backend developer, my goal is to build scalable, reliable, and efficient systems that solve real-world problems. My approach to software development is deeply rooted in best practices, such as clean code, robust testing, and documentation. I believe in continuous improvement, and I’m committed to expanding my skills in both established and emerging technologies.

### 📂 Featured Projects

- **[Shrinkit](https://github.com/Andres-Shadow/ShrinkIt)**: URL shortener designed as a technical deep dive into Hexagonal Architecture and clean coding. Made with SpringBoot and React, it combines backend rigor with frontend flexibility, creating custom handlers, Dto & BASE62+SHA256 encoding for secure links. ShrinkIt! showcases a full-stack solution that’s modular & maintainable. 🚀
- **[GreenGo](https://github.com/Andres-Shadow/GreenGo)**: an automated deployment tool built with Go, designed to streamline CI/CD pipelines by monitoring Git repositories and deploying changes efficiently using Docker Compose. Following Green Coding principles, it minimizes resource usage, making deployments faster and more sustainable.
- **[QuickCloud](https://github.com/Andres-Shadow/uqcloud)**: Here’s the translation: desktop computing environment that allows users to opportunistically leverage computing resources through virtualization from any network-connected device.
- **[Microservices Project](https://github.com/Andres-Shadow/Microservices)**: project for the Microservices Architecture course at the University of Quindío. Features JWT authentication, BDD testing, logging, health monitoring, account management, notifications, and gateway routing. All services are containerized with Docker Compose, integrated with Prometheus for health checks & fully documented with OpenAPI.
